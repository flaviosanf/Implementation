# Implementation

In this repository, we provide a collection of Python modules, as well as Jupyter and Mathematica notebooks, containing the numerical implementations and algorithms related to the results reported in the papers:

### Signatures of Cubic Gravity in the strong regime
The repository Sign_CubicGrav_Strong comprises two folders:

- ***Mathematica's notebook:*** This folder contains Mathematica notebooks presenting the analytical solutions for a static, spherically symmetric metric and the triangular configurations studied.
- ***Python jupyter's notebooks:*** This folder contains Jupyter notebooks used to validate the Mathematica results and generate plots, as well as Python modules designed for constructing numerical solutions for a static, spherically symmetric metric.
